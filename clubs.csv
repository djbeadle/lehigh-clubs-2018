bsr217@lehigh.edu,Brian,Reiff,"<p>Alpha Epsilon Pi was founded to provide opportunities for the Jewish college man seeking the best possible college and fraternity experience. We have maintained the integrity of our purpose by strengthening our ties to the Jewish community and serving as a link between high school and career.</p>
<p>Our heritage stems from one source: young Jewish men banding together in allegiance. The role of Alpha Epsilon Pi has expanded since its inception in 1913. Initially, the Jewish fraternity served as a brotherhood of young men who came from similar religious backgrounds and who had experienced the same prejudices against their religious beliefs. Alpha Epsilon Pi soon broadened its role to include serving as the living quarters for some of its members. The fraternity became a home away from home, providing the same stabilizing and guiding values that students previously gained from their families. Armed with these values, Alpha Epsilon Pi faced changing conditions on the college campus and survived. Today, Jewish students search out Alpha Epsilon Pi because it is a Jewish Fraternity. In the fraternity&rsquo;s 100-year history, over 93,000 men have worn the badge of Alpha Epsilon Pi and each year, over 2,500 undergraduates perform the Ritual of Initiation, which remains the same ritual adopted decades ago.</p>
<p>Perhaps of greater importance, Alpha Epsilon Pi develops leadership for the future of the American Jewish community. Tomorrow&rsquo;s Jewish leaders are in our chapters today. These are the young men who must be counted upon to support Jewish causes and to prepare to be one of tomorrow&rsquo;s Jewish leaders, so that they may aid themselves, their family, their community, and their people. Those students who enter the mainstream of non-Jewish life on the campus are far more likely to assimilate and to forsake their heritage. Working together with the Foundation for Jewish Campus Life/International Hillel, Alpha Epsilon Pi can play a vital role in helping reverse the growing trend among our young people to abandon Judaism at this critical time.</p>
<p>Throughout our history, the fraternity setting has served as a &ldquo;learning laboratory&rdquo;, a testing ground for young men who later become leaders in business, education, government, religion, and science. A goal of our fraternity is to help each student to develop character, to learn responsibility, and to develop a proper set of values through living together in brotherhood. Alpha Epsilon Pi prepares young men for their role in life as responsible citizens.</p>
<p><strong>Therefore, our basic purpose is to provide the opportunity for a Jewish man to be able to join a Jewish organization whose purpose is not specifically religious, but rather social and cultural in nature. Alpha Epsilon Pi is a Jewish fraternity, though non-discriminatory and open to all who are willing to espouse its purpose and values.</strong></p>",Alpha Epsilon Pi,Active,https://www.facebook.com/lehighaepi,http://www.sigmaetaaepi.com/,,,,,,,,,,,
cat217@lehigh.edu,Caroline,Tkachuk,"<p>Alpha Gamma Delta, fraternity for women, was founded at Syracuse University, Syracuse, New York on May 30, 1904. Alpha Gamma Delta was officially founded at the home of Dr. Wellesley Perry Coddington, a professor at Syracuse University. Dr. Coddington graduated from Wesleyan University in 1860 and was a member of Eclectic Fraternity, Phi Nu Theta and Phi Beta Kappa.&nbsp; He became one of the first five members of Syracuse University&rsquo;s faculty in 1871 and was instrumental in the early development of Alpha Gamma Delta.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>From 1900-1905, enrollment at Syracuse doubled and this led Dr. Coddington to discuss the need for more organizations with Marguerite Shepard, Because Marguerite was ending her junior year and would soon be graduating, she shared Dr. Coddington&rsquo;s idea with her younger sister, Estelle, a member of the class of 1908.&nbsp; Estelle saw the chance to make college friendships deeper and discussed the possibility with her close friend, Georgia Dickover.&nbsp; These three women embraced the idea and made a list of other women to consider for membership.&nbsp; With Marguerite, Estelle and Georgia&rsquo;s approval, Dr. Coddington spoke with Jennie Titus, a member of his ethics class about the opportunity.&nbsp; She joined the group at their second meeting and became an energetic and eager worker.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>On May 30, 1904, eleven pioneering women came together to form Alpha Gamma Delta.&nbsp; Since the founding, collegiate chapters have been installed at 181 colleges and universities across North America and more than 145,000 women have become Alpha Gam sisters. Guided by our Purpose, Alpha Gamma Deltas are impacting our communities and contributing to the world's work.</p>
<p>With the chartering of Tau chapter at the University of Toronto in 1919, Alpha Gamma Delta became an International Women&rsquo;s Fraternity. Furthermore, Alpha Gamma Delta was admitted into the National Panhellenic Conference in 1909.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Being a sister at Alpha Gam means more than a house you share with your friends, it is a place every sister can call their home.&nbsp; We pride ourselves on our high ideals, campus involvement and strong friendships.&nbsp; Whether it is giving an ASA tour, helping out with the community or performing in Lehigh's latest show, Alpha Gam's support each other with all theirs endeavours.&nbsp;</p>

One of our most important goals is to unify the&nbsp;Lehigh family - past, present, and future.</p>
<p>ASA was founded by a diverse group of eleven highly motivated and enthusiastic students in 2002. Their mission was to develop an organization that would help to create and enhance traditions that promote alumni involvement through unity, spirit, and community outreach activities.&nbsp;The goals of the founding eleven are very much a part of the goals of the ASA of today.&nbsp;<br /> <br /> We want to help current students have a positive Lehigh experience so that they will stay connected, engaged, and involved after graduation. We strive to provide Alumni with opportunities to stay connected to their Alma Mater by fostering strong bonds that enrich the experiences of current students. We will continue to establish and uphold traditions while instilling and perpetuating an atmosphere of excitement and pride within the Lehigh Community.</p>
<p>We also believe active involvement in our surrounding neighborhoods, on the part of students, is essential to shape the community leaders of today and tomorrow.&nbsp;We are the Association of Student Alumni - Committed to cultivating strong ties with Lehigh and with alumni.</p>",Association of Student Alumni,Active,http://www.facebook.com/lehighasa,http://lehighasa.weebly.com/,,,,,,,,,,http://www.twitter.com/LehighASA,LehighASA

Each competition consists of multiple dynamic events and an off-road race. There are three competitions held each year, in which 100 teams from around the world must prove that their car is safe, well-engineered, cost-effective, fast, maneuverable, and able to endure an off-road environment. In addition to the performance of the car, the team is judged on two detailed reports: one for design and one for cost.</p>
<p>The cars are put to the test with dynamic events, where teams compete in acceleration, hill climbing, maneuverability, and more. Each competition ends with a 4-hour endurance race, including obstacles such as creeks, jumps, hairpin turns, and other difficult terrain and manmade obstacles. When cars break down, teams are expected to use their problem solving skills to perform onsite repairs and get their car back in the race.</p>

<p>Bridges to Prosperity (B2P) engages university students from around the world, providing opportunities to use their academic training on a real-life, practical project. Many students are able to fulfill their senior design or service-learning requirements by working with B2P.</p>
<p>Once you start a University Chapter at your school, there are a number of ways to be involved in a B2P bridge project. The core of our University Program consists of Chapter Projects, where students manage entire projects from start to finish while taking advantage of B2P&rsquo;s technical resources and one-on-one support from technical mentors. Program Projects, in which student teams are assigned to a bridge project and receive direct support from B2P field staff, serve as a training mechanism to empower students to complete Chapter Projects in subsequent years. University Chapters who elect not to build a bridge have the option of traveling on inspection trips for completed B2P bridges and exploring topics relevant to our work through research and development, including non-technical projects.</p>",Bridges to Prosperity,Active,https://www.facebook.com/BridgesToProsperityLehigh,www.bridgestoprosperity.org,,,,,,,,,,,

dse215@lehigh.edu,Doug,Ebersole,"<p><strong>Lehigh University Class Officer- Program Overview</strong></p>
<p><strong>What is the Class Officer (CO) Program? </strong></p>
<p>The CO Program is a group of elected students that represent their class and serve as a liaison between the Lehigh Fund and the student body. Class officers provide strong, consistent representation of the class to students, faculty, staff, alumni and administration and are tasked with unifying their class through the promotion of philanthropy.</p>
<p>The class officer program at Lehigh is unique as it does not play the role of student government. Here at Lehigh, that role is reserved for Lehigh&rsquo;s Student Senate. The class officer program is a necessity for the institution as many of the campus programs, student organizations, and opportunities here at Lehigh would not exist without annual giving. The class officer program highlights philanthropy because of its connection to the Lehigh Fund.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<strong>What is the Lehigh Fund? </strong></p>
<p>The Lehigh Fund is an annual giving program whose purpose is to raise funds to support Lehigh University&rsquo;s highest priorities. Each year the Lehigh Fund raises over $16 million that provides immediate support for student life programs, the academic experience, and financial aid.

sps218@lehigh.edu,Sarah,Stern,"<p>The Garden Club&nbsp;focuses on three pillars of Permaculture, which are Earth Care, People Care, and Fair Share. Permaculture emphasizes the ""edge"", or where two different things meet, so our focus is primarily on community building in the Southside area. We have embodied each of our pillars in this light. For earth care, we take care of 4 community gardens bordering the Southside. For people care, we have an educational program with Boys &amp; Girls Club of Bethlehem since the summer, and we are looking forward to beginning an after-school program with Broughal Middle School. During these programs, we have had the children paint bricks to label our vegetables, made zucchini pizza and pickled our own cucumbers, taught them about composting and even had them compost with us in our garden. Finally, for fair share, the majority of our yields are donated to New Bethany food pantry to help those in the community without ready access to fresh produce. We are already in talks with Lehigh's Space Committee and hope to establish an educational Permaculture garden on campus so that Lehigh students can learn about its principles as well. We operate on the philosophy that ""You don't have to leave your community to live in a better one"". We find that our mission is unique in that we are encouraging community building around the garden so that Southside residents and Lehigh Students alike can have a personal stake in their community as well as learn more about growing their own food, which is a significant aspect of a more sustainable lifestyle.</p>",Community Growers,Active,http://www.facebook.com/clip.permacultureinitiative,,,,,,,,,,,,LehighCLIP

<p>Kappa Alpha Psi, a Greek letter college Fraternity, was founded on January 5th, 1911 at Indiana University, Bloomington Indiana by a group of 10 astute men in spite of many obstacles. The racial climate at Indiana during the early 20th century was quite tenuous, and the founders of the Fraternity sought to create an organization that would never exclude or suggest the exclusion of a man from membership merely because of his color, creed, or national origin.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The fraternity&rsquo;s presence at Lehigh University began on April 18, 1987, when the Lehigh Expansion colony of the Kappa Gamma Chapter of Kappa Alpha Psi Fraternity was established by three undergraduate students - Wayne Bethea, Ron Howard, and Terry Williams. The Omicron Kappa Chapter at Lehigh University was founded on May 18th, 2001 after Brothers of Kappa Alpha Psi were present on campus for over 14 years. Currently, Omicron Kappa is host to the Ursinus College Colony of Kappa Alpha Psi. This chapter boasts a diverse membership of brothers who are involved in many positive initiatives in their communities, and who strive to achieve in everything they do. This is evidenced by the many prestigious accolades bestowed upon the OK chapter.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In the 2009-2010 school-year, the Brothers were honored with Gold Chapter status by Lehigh&rsquo;s Office of Fraternity &amp; Sorority Affairs for the second straight year, and were named Northeastern Province Chapter of the year by the Fraternity&rsquo;s governing body in 2008-2009. The chapter was also honored by the University by being named Undergraduate Student Organization of the Year at the 2010 Student Life Leadership Awards.</p>

Whether you find our office to be your home away from home; a safe space; an area to broaden your horizons; a place to host a program or event; a study area;&nbsp; a place for you to discuss issues on campus; or merely a place to rest and have a bite to eat in between classes, we welcome you to explore, share, learn and be challenged.<br /> <br /> Multiculturalism, broadly defined, is the idea that ""several different cultures can coexist peacefully and equitably"" (WordNet, Princeton University, 2006). At Lehigh, multiculturalism is about recognizing, accepting and celebrating differences within our campus and surrounding communities. The Office of Multicultural Affairs at Lehigh (OMA) believes that by providing a space for students to explore their multiple identities and learn about the backgrounds and experiences of others, we can all create a culture of inclusion and equity here on campus and beyond.<br /> <br /> We offer a range of programs,discussions, social events, resources, guest lectures and events to get you started down the path of self-discovery. If you've already started these processes, OMA programs and services can offer ways to increase your knowledge, enhance your skills and deepen your appreciation for diversity.<br /> <br /> We are here to help you celebrate your unique contributions to this wonderfully complex society, while recognizing equal value in the contributions of others. Perhaps most importantly, we challenge you to think critically and become leaders in resolving the world's toughest issues related to diversity. <br /> <br /> I invite you to become an active member of Lehigh's multicultural family. Let's grow together and be true agents of change!</p>

<p><strong>Lehigh University Office of Residence Life</strong></p>
<p><strong>Mission Statement</strong></p>
<p>The Office of Residence Life's mission is to foster a safe and inclusive learning-focused community that complements the academic mission of the University and partners with students on their personal, professional, and civic development.</p>
<p>To accomplish this mission, our department provides a live-in, professional Assistant Director (AD), who oversees each residential area. The Assistant Directors supervise the Gryphons who live in the residence halls. The Gryphons serve as a resource and peer leader to students, and they coordinate programs and activities that support student learning. The Gryphons serve on a rotating duty schedule and are available to students in the evenings and on weekends.</p>
<p>The Office of Residence Life can also serve as your liaison to other resources on campus, and we are eager to assist you in any way we can.</p>

<p>Living in a residence hall is one of the most important elements of being a college student, and we try to make the experience as interesting and enjoyable as possible. At Lehigh, a residence hall is not simply a ""dorm."" Instead, it is a place to make new friends, study, relax, socialize, sleep, and attend interesting and educational programs. Primarily, a residence hall is a place to call home during your four years at Lehigh. All residence halls are close to the classrooms, the dining halls, the fitness center/gymnasium and the libraries, so it's a quick walk to the services and resources that Lehigh provides.</p>
<p>All of Lehigh's first-year residential options provide a safe, well-maintained homelike space to live, study, and learn from other residents. A variety of lifestyle options are available for upper class. If you're excited about apartment living, Lehigh offers three fantastic complexes: Campus Square, Sayre Park Village, and Trembley Park. The Warren Square complex offers theme housing opportunities for a unique living experience. Each residence hall has special features, so read each description carefully to see all of the residential choices Lehigh has to offer.</p>
<p>Lehigh's residence halls are staffed and run by talented and supportive people who can help you with any problem you might face at any time of the day or night. Our staff is committed to encouraging personal growth through educational programming and advising. They are there to help make your experience in the residence hall a rewarding one.</p>
<p>We hope you find that Lehigh feels like home, no matter which residence option you choose.</p>
<p>Good Luck - we think you'll like it here!</p>

Market Street, Bethlehem, PA.&nbsp; In 1963, the SigEp moved into a house built for them on the Lehigh Campus in Sayre Park (commonly referred to as &ldquo;The Hill&rdquo;).</p>
<p>In 1991, Pennsylvania Epsilon had it&rsquo;s charter revoked by the national fraternity, not due to any particular incident, but instead for a general decline in chapter standards.&nbsp; SigEp re-colonized at Lehigh in 1994, moved back into their house on &ldquo;The Hill&rdquo; in 1995 and was re-charted on November 16, 1996 as a Balanced Man Chapter.&nbsp; The chapter celebrated it&rsquo;s centennial anniversary at Lehigh University&nbsp; with a Gala Celebration to benefit SigEp&rsquo;s national charity YouthAids on September 29, 2007.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Lehigh&rsquo;s SigEp stands out and strives to be the best because all of our brothers live up to our house vision. Our brothers are defined by our commitment to academic success, personal achievement, community involvement, and fraternal endeavors.

<p>As a member of the United States Collegiate Ski and Snowboard Association, the Ski Club is one of the most active athletic clubs at Lehigh during their season. Racing on both Saturday and Sunday of every weekend from early January until mid-March, the ski team requires a great commitment and is not meant for beginners.</p>
<p>In addition to the races, the team practices twice a week at&nbsp;Camelback. The races, however, occur throughout ski mountains in New Jersey, New York and Pennsylvania and usually feature such rivals as Lafayette, Columbia, Rutgers and Princeton, among others.</p>
<p>Throughout their storied history&mdash;which spans more than a decade&mdash;the Lehigh skiers&mdash;both men and women&mdash;have been utterly dominant. The men have claimed the conference championship in each of the last eight seasons and have competed in the national championship competition for the last two years, marking the first two times in Lehigh history that such a feat was accomplished.</p>
<p>The women&rsquo;s side has been almost as impressive. Prior to 2004, the women&rsquo;s team had never raced at the regionals&mdash;until they spouted off three consecutive seasons in which they qualified.</p>
<p>The ski team remains one of the few teams that does not cut anyone. &ldquo;Anyone who has had some type of skiing experience is welcome to join us,&rdquo; said team president Greg Brentrup. &ldquo;We have all abilities, from really experienced racers to people who have never raced. But we are all able to train together, help each other&hellip;and have a lot of fun doing it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Another differentiation of the ski team from other clubs at Lehigh is the length of their season&mdash;only 6 weeks long. &ldquo;I also don't think that too many club sports teams at Lehigh have competed on a national level,&rdquo; said Brentrup. &ldquo;So that is really exciting for us as a team and definitely a point of pride&hellip;Being able to travel to Colorado to compete last year [in Nationals] was an incredible experience.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The ski team maintains its high level of competition and tradition year after year with a carefully designed hierarchy. As there is no coach, the team is run strictly by elected officers. Of the four officer position, Brentrup says, &ldquo;Our president is almost always a senior, but we often have sophomores and juniors filling our other three officer positions. We like to have one new sophomore officer each year so that they can have two seasons as an officer before taking over as the probable president in their senior year.&rdquo;</p>
<p>As displayed by their stellar achievements and bright future, the ski team clearly has a polished and working system in place.</p>
